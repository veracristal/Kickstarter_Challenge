# ***Kickstarter-Challenge***

## **Project Overview**

Louise is a playwriter, and started a crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever". Her goal is to get her estimated budget of $10,000 funded. 

### *Purpose*

This analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns failed or succeeded according to the dates the kickstarter campaigns launched as well as their monetary goals.

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### *Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date*

According to the tendencies shown in the data for crowdfunding, the ideal month to launch a campaign is the month of May. The months with the most number of failed projects are May, June, July and October.

### *Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals*

The following table shows the percentages of plays that were either funded successfully, failed to get funded or canceled THe chart also breaks downthe number of plays depending on predefined brackets of amount of money needed per their goal.

### *Challenges and Difficulties Encountered*

For me, the main challenge or difficulty was while creating the Outcomes Based on Goals chart. The main reason being that the information from the Kickstarter worksheet included the "live" outcome. In our data analysis, we did not include that information. Therefore I had a discrepancy of 19 plays between the total number of plays considered in the analysis and the total number of plays in the Kickstarter original data.

When I first encountered the problem, I could not see pass it. It was after I took a break, and retraced the steps, that I could figure out that the data included an outcome (live) that we were not taking into account for the analysis.

## **Results**

- According to the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, we can establish that the best month to launch a fundraising campaign is the month of May. Another conclusion that we can draw from that table is that during the months of May, June, July and October, the number of campaigns that did not meet their fundraising goal was at the highest.

- The highest percentage of successful outcomes is when their goal is between $0 and $4,999. the highest percentage of failed outcomes is when the goal was set between $25,000 and $29,000.

- In order for this analysis to be as complete as possible, we are missing one important piece of information, and that is that we do not have information on when Louise launched her fundraising  campaign.

- We can create a statistics table, and with that information we could create a box and whisker chart. This will help us visualize outliers, and how that can affect the outcome of our analysis. We can also create a Stacked column chart to visualize better the percentages of successful, live, failed and canceled plays.
